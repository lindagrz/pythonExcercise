# 1. Exercise - Age 100
#
#     Write a program that asks for and saves a username
#     Ask a question about the user's age, using the username in the question.
#     Shows in how many years the user will be 100 years old smile
#     BONUS: Let the program also show the year when the user will be 100 years old.
#     It could use a variable with the current year.
#     It would be even better to get the current year automatically
#     then you will need two additional lines:
#     import datetime # let's talk about imports separately
#     currentYear = datetime.datetime.now (). year
#
# 2. Exercise - Room volume
#
#     Ask user to input 3 numbers - width, length, height
#     Find the volume of the room
#     PS Think about units and what is the most appropriate data type for this
#
# 3. Exercise - Temperature Conversion
#
#     Write a program that asks user for temperature in Celsius and prints out this same temperature in Farenheit
#     formula is: farenheit = 32+celsius*(9/5)
#     PS Remember about data type conversion, also consider precision
